# RT Proxy
RT Proxy is a simple tool to proxy RT requests (see [A standard for RT'ing?](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/03/aStandardForRting.html)) to different social sites.

This page takes three possible query string parameters: title, link and description although Delicious is currently the only service that takes a description.
